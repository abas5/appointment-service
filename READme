Appointment Scheduler Service


This is a simple service that schedules appointments 
and views a list of appointments made.


To build the docker image (Make sure you are in the appointment-service home directory)
Run 'docker build -t  appointment-service .'

To run the container run:
'docker run -d -p 82:82 appointment-service'

Now had over to ' http://localhost:82/ ' to check out the app

# Endpoint 1: Create an appointment via /set-appointment
Accepts two params:
    - USER ID: Integer e.g 73
    - DATE: String e.g 12/02/2022 2:00 ! Only handles this date format as of now.
To send a POST request via command line:
    Enter this command
        - ` curl -d "&userid=73 &date=12/02/2022 2:00" -X POST http://0.0.0.0:82/set-appointment `

# Endpoint 2: View all the appointments made by a specific user via /appointments/<USER_ID>
Accpets one param:
    - USER ID: Integer e.g 73
To view appointments by user id use the /appointments/<USER_ID> endpoint: 'http://localhost:82/appointments/<USER_ID>'
    - This will return a list of appointments by user ID

# IF I HAD MORE TIME...
- I would create unit tests to make sure my code is tested and
does not have regression when building new features or fixing bugs.
- All of my logic is in the app.py file. With more time I would have created a separate
module with a class and smaller functions. 
- There is more validations I could have handle as well as more ways to accept the date format.
